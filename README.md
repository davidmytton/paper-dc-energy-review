## Summary

> Data centers are a critical component of information technology (IT),
> providing an environment for running computer equipment. Reliance on data
> centers for everyday activities has brought increased scrutiny of their energy
> footprint, yet the literature presents a wide range of estimates with
> challenging-to-validate calculations that make it difficult to rely on their
> subsequent estimates. In this review, we analyze 258 data center energy
> estimates from 46 original publications between 2007 and 2021 to assess their
> reliability by examining the 676 sources used. We show that 31% of sources
> were from peer-reviewed publications, 38% were from non-peer-reviewed reports,
> and many lacked clear methodologies and data provenance. We also highlight
> issues with source availability—there is a reliance on private data from IDC
> (43%) and Cisco (30%), 11% of sources had broken web links, and 10% were cited
> with insufficient detail to locate. We make recommendations to 3 groups of
> stakeholders on how to improve and better understand the literature—end users
> who make use of data center energy estimates (e.g., journalists), the research
> community (e.g., academics), and policy makers or regulators within the energy
> sector (e.g., grid operators).
