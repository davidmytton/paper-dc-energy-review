## Summary

> Data centers are a critical component of Information Technology (IT),
> providing an environment for running computer equipment. Reliance on data
> centers for everyday activities has seen increased scrutiny of their energy
> footprint, yet the literature presents a wide range of estimates with
> challenging to validate calculations that makes it difficult to rely on their
> subsequent estimates. In this review, we analyze 258 data center energy
> estimates from 46 original publications between 2007 and 2021 to assess their
> reliability through examining the 676 sources used. We show that 31% of
> sources were from peer-reviewed publications, 38% were from non-peer reviewed
> reports, and many lacked clear methodologies and data provenance. We also
> highlight issues with source availability - there is a reliance on private
> data from IDC (43%) and Cisco (30%), 11% of sources had broken web links, and
> 10% were cited with insufficient detail to locate. We make recommendations to
> 3 groups of stakeholders for how to improve and better understand the
> literature - end-users who make use of data center energy estimates e.g.
> journalists; the research community e.g. academics; and policy-makers or
> regulators within the energy sector e.g. grid operators.
