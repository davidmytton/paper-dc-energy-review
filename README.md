## Summary

> Data centers are a critical component of Information Technology (IT),
> providing a reliable environment for computer equipment such as servers and
> storage systems. Reliance on data centers for everyday activities has seen
> increased scrutiny of their environmental impact. In this review, we analyze
> original data center energy estimates published between 2007 and 2021.
> Breaking down 46 individual publications into 676 data provenance traces, we
> map citations used by each publication to assess reliability and highlight
> methodological challenges. We show that 38% of sources were from peer-reviewed
> publications and 31% were from non-peer reviewed reports with many lacking
> clear methodologies and data provenance. We also highlight issues with source
> availability - there is a general reliance on private data from IDC and
> Gartner, 11% of sources had broken URLs, and 10% were cited with insufficient
> detail to locate. These findings pose challenges for the reliability and
> reproducibility of estimates important for planning the energy systems of the
> future.
